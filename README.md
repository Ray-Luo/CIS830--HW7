# Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition Final Project
Predicted memory usage on Beocat (K-Stateâ€™s HPC server) using its log data and multiple machine learning techniques using Scikit learn, such as KNN, ANN, and SVR.

Constructed a complete processing pipeline from problem definition to model comparison and selection.
